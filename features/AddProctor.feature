Feature: Add proctorâ€™s details manually 
         As a proctor manager 
         So that I can create one or more proctor and details by myself 
         I want to be able to add one or more proctor into the table 


    
    Background: go to add proctor
     
    Given the following rooms exist:
   | id | number        |   build           | 
   | 1  | EN318         |   Engineering     | 
   | 2  | SC205         |   SCBuilding      |
    
    Given I am on the Proctors home page
    When I follow "Add Proctor"
    Then I should be on the Add proctor page
    
Scenario: add a proctor (Happy path)
    
    When I fill in "proctor_name" with "Tonsak yungme"
    And  I fill in "proctor_position" with "Staff"
    And  I fill in "proctor_tel" with "0829929130"
    And  I fill in "proctor_email" with "k@gmail.com"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should be on the Proctor show page 
    When I follow "Back"
    Then I should be on the Proctor page
    And I should see "Tonsak yungme"
